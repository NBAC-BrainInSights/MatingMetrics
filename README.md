# MatingMetrics

**MatingMetrics** explores the fascinating intersection of cognitive preferences, physical attractiveness markers (like WHR and BMI), and short-term and long-term mating strategies, particularly in individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). This repository includes the Psychtoolbox task implementation, analysis scripts, and study documentation.

## Project Overview

Mating behaviors range from short-term strategies emphasizing immediate reproductive opportunities to long-term strategies focused on stable pair bonding and cooperative parenting. This project investigates how cognitive preferences (e.g., systemizing traits) and physical attractiveness cues (e.g., BMI and WHR) shape mating strategies in ASC individuals compared to typically developing individuals.

### Key Research Questions
1. Do individuals with ASC prioritize cognitive compatibility over physical attractiveness cues in mate selection?
2. How do universal attractiveness cues like WHR and BMI influence short-term and long-term mating preferences?
3. What role does neurodiversity play in shaping human mating strategies?
